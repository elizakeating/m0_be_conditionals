# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - It is useful to use a `conditional` in your code when you have many different conditions that would lead to different outcomes. For instance if you had a username that was correct but a password that was incorrect, you would get one answer, and if you had both that were correct, you would get another.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - Pay attention to the order of things the first time. For the medium challenge I originally had it so that one of my conditions would never be called, and it took me a minute to realize what the mistake was.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - One thing that brought me a lot of satisfaction is that I was able to reason through each of them logically, and if it included something I didn't know how to do, all I had to do was look it up. It was also super cool to find the `even?` function when researching about the `%` operator.
